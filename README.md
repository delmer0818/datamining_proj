COMPARING PREDICTIVE ALGORITHMS OF LINEAR REGRESSION, NAÏVE BAYESIAN AND k-NEAREST NEIGHBORS ON LOUISVILLE CRIME DATA USING RAPIDMINER 
 
Abstract: 

In this paper we are comparing three different predictive algorithms - Linear Regression, 
Naïve Bayesian and k-Nearest Neighbor using the data mining tool RapidMiner.  The data 
used in this project is crime data pulled from the Louisville Metro Government portal - 
http://portal.louisvilleky.gov/dataset/crimedataall-data.  The data is reduced and formatted 
then it is used to build the predictive models.  The predictive values produced by each model 
will then be compared at the conclusion.
